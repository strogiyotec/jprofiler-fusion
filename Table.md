| Memory profiling          |                                                                                                   Supports GC roots, Biggest objects, Allocation recording                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                             Supports GC roots, Persistent Heap snapshots, Support the Diff between two snapshots to see memory regression |
| CPU profiling             | Keeps track of all method calls with the time and build a call tree for each execution, each branch in the tree can be filtered(Search by a class name). Each branch shows the current thread state. For better visibility the tree can by displayed as graph | FusionReactor supports CPU sampler that retrieves all active threads and their CPU info. The CPU data can be persisted using the snapshotting. Two snapshots can be compared with each other using diff to see CPU performance regression |
| Database profiling        |                                                                   Supports JDBC and some other NOSQL protocols.
